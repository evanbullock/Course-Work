<h1>The Cubic</h2>
<p>
A polynomial of degree three is called a cubic, and an equation invloving a cubic polynomial whose value is zero is called a cubic equation.
the solutions of a cubic equation are a called the <i>roots</i> of the polynomial.Figure 1 shows the graph of a cupic polynomial.

As with quadratics, the ideas around cubic polynomials were familiar to ancient people, 
including the Babylonians.However, those ancients were not nearly as good at solving for the roots of cubics
as they were at quadratics.It was not until the time of Tartaglia (1500-1557) and Cardano (1501-1576)
that Europeans began to be able to solve a general calss of cubics.
</p>
<p>
Cubics are handled very similarly to quadratics-indeed, the problem of finding their roots devolves to finding one root, factoring the polynomial,
and then using the quadratic formula on the part that remains. We can write a general cubic polynomial as
\[p(x)=ax^3+bx^2+d\]
Naturally we have a tacit assumption that 
\(a\neq 0,\)
since otherwise the polynomial would have degree less than three.For simplicity we assume that all the coefficients are real,
though the following expressions remain valid when they are complex.We note that inasmuch as the dominant term
\(x^3\) goes toward positive infinity as \(x\) increases, and toward negative infinity as \(x\) decreases, there is always a point where the cubic has value zero.
In other words, we are guaranteed one real root.

<p>
In writing the roots of the polynomial, there is a term that occurs often. Let

where
\(B=2b^3-9abc+27a^2d\) and \(C=b^2-3ac.\) Using this notation, we can write the first root of \(p\)
as 
\[\Lambda_0 =-\frac{1}{3a}b+\Lambda+\frac{C}{\Lambda}\]
The other two roots come from the quadratic that results when the linear factor from this root is divided
out of the cubic polynomial.Letting \(\sigma=\frac{1}{2}(-1+i\sqrt{3}),\)
the first of those roots has the form \(p\) as
\[\Lambda_1 =-\frac{1}{3a}b+\sigma\Lambda+\frac{C}{\sigma\Lambda}.\]
The other root \(\Lambda_2\) is obtained from this last expression by replacing \(\sigma\) by \(\bar{\sigma}.\)
